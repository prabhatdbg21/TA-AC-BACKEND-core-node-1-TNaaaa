    <h1>Normal readFile and Streams</h1>
    <p>
        The concept of streams in computing usually describes the delivery of data in a steady, continuous flow.
         You can use streams for 
        reading from or writing to a source continuously, thus eliminating the need to fit all the data in memory at once.
